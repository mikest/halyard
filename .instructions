Halyard is rope simulation library written in GDScript (Godot 4.0 syntax) and C++.

GDScript (files ending in *.gd) should be written with the godot style guide.
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html#

The GDScript language reference can be found here:
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html

All GDScript variables should be strongly typed.

Use godot-cpp/test/src/example.cpp and godot-cpp/test/src/example.h for examples of how to construct GDExtension classes.
